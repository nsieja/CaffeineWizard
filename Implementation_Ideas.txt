This document is used for:

a) Conceptual Notes / Ideas and
b) Implementation steps that will be deleted once implemented


a. Notes / Ideas

* Use Pyforms module to integrate open source API for user interface similar to Windows Forms (simple)



b. Implementations

* Script for calculations
* Function cafCalculate(caffeine, drinkTime, projectionTime, *k1, *k2) | returns cafModel
    - caffeine is amount in mg (recommend to user: 80mg)
    - drinkTime is time to drink (recommend to user: 10min)
    - projectionTime is time to plot response (recommend 4hr)
    - k1,k2 are optional inputs (default values determined by research in "sources")
    - returns cafModel, a tupel containing 1 list of floats corresponding to caffeine levels in GI tract, 
      1 list of floats corresponding to caffeine levels in blood, and 1 list of floats that represent the 
      time (independent variable) for plotting purposes

* Script for graphing
* Function cafPlot()
