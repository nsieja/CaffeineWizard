# CaffeineWizard
Building an application for users to interact with their caffeine intake

Intention is to migrate a past project from MATLAB to Python and
expand the scope to include current features (graphing caffeine
levels in blood and GI tract over time following intake) and new
features such as modifying assumed constants based on user input,
predicting tolerances, tracking drinks/data, and interactive graphs.
